This folder is about how to use Google Tests (gtest next).

STEP 1:
    Install gtest:
        $ sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev
        $ sudo apt-get install cmake

        $ cd /usr/src/gtest
        $ sudo make CMakeLists.txt
        $ sudo make

        $ sudo cp *.a /usr/lib
        
    And now this is ready for using!

STEP 2:
    Write your program like my_program.cpp
    
    Write testing program like testing_program.cpp
    
    Compile this two programs as common project. But dont forget to add -lgtest keys to let linker knows about gtest lib.
    You also need to add -lpthread, because gtest uses this lib.
        $ g++ my_program.cpp testing_program.cpp -o example.out -lpthread -lgtest

STEP 3:
    Just enjoy your life with easy to use test framework :)
